Hello everyone, and get to know the weather.

Since the beginning of the three-ninth cold air, it has begun to slack off, leading to the gradual development and development of fog and haze in North China and Huanghuai, and today is the worst visibility in the near future. The visibility of these deep red areas on the map is generally less than 500 meters.

There is still heavy fog or thick fog from Tianjin to the north of Hunan this evening to tomorrow morning. Among them, the visibility in the southwestern part of Shandong, the eastern part of Henan, the northern and southern parts of Anhui, and the central part of Hubei are less than 200 meters. In some areas, there are even strong fogs with visibility less than 50 meters.

In the daytime, the fog will turn into a halo in some places during the day, but it will be weakened by the weak cold air in the central part of North China, and the place south of the place will have to wait until the background night, a relatively strong cold air. The arrival of fog and cockroaches gradually weakened and dissipated from north to south.

The cost of recreating the blue sky is to cool down. Tomorrow, the northeastern region will generally cool down by 2-6 degrees. The day after tomorrow, there will be a stronger cooling down from west to east.

For example, the highest temperature in Shenyang today is 0 degrees above 0, which is 9 degrees higher than the average maximum temperature in the same period of the year. This can be said to be a rare warmth in three or nine days. However, the maximum temperature is only next Tuesday. There are 0 and 7 degrees left. Temperatures in most parts of the North, including Shenyang and next Monday, will fall back to the same level, or even slightly lower.

Pay attention to precipitation. From Jiangnan to Tomorrow this evening, there is still a lot of rain in southern China. In addition, there will be large blizzards in parts of western Tibet.
Let's take a look at the specific city weather forecast.
